FOSTER CARE - SUPPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Built a Java Swing application to give children in many areas access to a centralized system for meeting their fundamental requirements within a non-profit foster support organization.
This program helps youngsters be cared for in a way that doesn't deprive them of necessities and significantly influences their development. Universities are assigned based on the rules, counselors are assigned, kids get checked out in hospitals, NGOs ask restaurants to take care of their requirements, and delivery people accept orders. The program collects data on how Foster Support NGOs are doing generally.
The application's data was kept in the DB4O object database.
When a user registers, an email JAR with built-in email capabilities notifies them. 
To visualize your data, display bar charts, line charts, and pie charts using jFreeChart-Jar is done.
To fill the database, a fake class was used.
Allowed Roles and Functions for Systems Including Various Organizations, Enterprises, and Businesses in Different Networks.

Installation Requirements To Run The Application.
•	NetBeans
•	Must Have JDK 15.
•	Download all the required JAR files used in the application.
